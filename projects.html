                <h2> Client: WayPoint Cafe NYC </h2>
                <p> WayPoint Cafe NYC is an e-sports cafe located on Ludlow St. in Chinatown, NYC. They needed a new
                    website to go along with their increasing exposure to the gaming community of the East Coast. This
                    website was created using SquareSpace. A simple Google Analytics report with dashboards was also set
                    up to see where website visitors came from. </p>
