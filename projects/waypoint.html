                <p> WayPoint Cafe NYC is an e-sports cafe located on Ludlow St. in Chinatown, NYC. They needed a new website to go along with their increasing exposure to the gaming community of the East Coast. This website was created using SquareSpace. A simple Google Analytics report with dashboards was also set up to see where website visitors came from. </p>
